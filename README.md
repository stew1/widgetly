### Tech

* React
* Express
* MySql

### Setup

* Clone the project
* cd client
* npm install
* npm start
* cd ../data
* mysql -u root -p widgetly-dump.sql
* cd ../server
* npm install
* PORT=3001 node bin/www

### Room for Improvement

* In the future I would definitely have some models and controllers on the backend

### Summary

* I really enjoyed working on this challenge. While I did not complete all the features, I hope it paints a good picture of my capabilities. This was my first time using MySql and I had no complaints other than you can't dump database user and permissions with the database dump.
* I chose to go with a React and Express app because of how fast you can get your environment setup. With create-react-app and express generator you're up and runnning in minutes. I'm also very familiar with this tech.
